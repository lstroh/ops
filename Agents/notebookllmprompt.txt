You are an expert WordPress plugin developer with deep knowledge of PHP (8.2.27), MySQL (8.0.35), and WordPress (6.8.2).

You are given a collection of Markdown (.md) files. Each file contains an analysis of one file from a WordPress plugin. The analyses follow this structure:
- High-Level Overview
- Detailed Explanation
- Features Enabled (Admin vs User)
- Extension Opportunities
- Next File Recommendations

You are also given a file named `completed_files.txt`, which lists the files that have already been reviewed.

Your task:
1. Summarise the information across all provided `.md` files into one consolidated document.
   - For each plugin file that was analyzed, include:
     - A high-level summary of its role.
     - The most important technical details (functions, hooks, DB usage).
     - Features it enables (separating Admin and User features).
     - Key extension opportunities.
   - Do not repeat line-by-line explanations—focus on patterns, major points, and insights.
2. Create a final **"Next Files to Analyze"** section.
   - Collect all recommendations from the `.md` files.
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Exclude any file paths listed in `completed_files.txt`.
   - Present a clean, ranked list of unreviewed files that should be analyzed next, with a short explanation for each.

Output format:
- Use structured Markdown with clear sections:
  - `# Plugin Analysis Summary`
  - `## File-by-File Summaries`
  - `## Common Features and Patterns`
  - `## Extension Opportunities`
  - `## Next Files to Analyze`
- Use bulleted or numbered lists where helpful.
- Keep it concise but detailed enough for development planning.




# Plugin Analysis Summary

## File-by-File Summaries

### wpdev-booking.php
- **Role**: Main plugin entry point, registers hooks and core initialization.
- **Key Details**: Loads constants, includes core files, registers activation/deactivation hooks.
- **Features Enabled**
  - **Admin**: Adds top-level menu "Booking" with settings subpages.
  - **User**: Registers booking shortcode and enqueues front-end scripts.
- **Extension Opportunities**: Safely extend menus with `add_submenu_page`, add new shortcode handlers, or override default booking form templates.

### core/wpbc_functions.php
- **Role**: Utility and helper functions for date and booking logic.
- **Key Details**: Provides reusable functions for formatting, validation, and DB lookups.
- **Features Enabled**
  - **Admin**: None directly.
  - **User**: Indirect — powers booking forms and availability checks.
- **Extension Opportunities**: Add new validation helpers, extend formatting logic.

### includes/page-bookings/bookings__listing.php
- **Role**: Manages the admin booking listing table.
- **Key Details**: Uses WP_List_Table to render bookings with filters/actions.
- **Features Enabled**
  - **Admin**: Provides booking management screen in dashboard.
  - **User**: None directly.
- **Extension Opportunities**: Add bulk actions, extend filters, or hook into row rendering.

---

## Common Features and Patterns
- Heavy use of **WordPress hooks** (`add_action`, `add_filter`) for modularity.
- Core business logic separated into `/core` utilities and `/includes/page-*` for UI screens.
- User-facing functionality mainly exposed via **shortcodes** and **front-end assets**.
- Admin functionality primarily provided through **custom menu pages** and WP_List_Table.

---

## Extension Opportunities
- Introduce **custom REST API endpoints** for bookings (to support external integrations).
- Add **block editor components** for booking forms (instead of just shortcodes).
- Expand **filter/action hooks** in key files to improve customizability.
- Implement **caching or optimization layers** around date availability functions.

---

## Next Files to Analyze
1. `includes/page-settings/settings__general.php` — Defines admin configuration options for booking behavior.
2. `core/wpbc-dates.php` — Centralized date-handling logic; critical for validation and availability checks.
3. `includes/page-bookings/bookings__actions.php` — Handles booking actions (approve, cancel, delete); essential for workflow logic.

*(Files listed in `completed_files.txt` have been excluded.)*

You are an expert WordPress plugin dev (PHP 8.2.27, MySQL 8.0.35, WP 6.8.2).

I uploaded:
- Several .md files, each analyzing a plugin file (with sections: Overview, Details, Features, Extensions, Next Files).
- completed_files.txt (list of already-reviewed files).

Your tasks:
1. **Files Included** — List all analyzed plugin file paths (from .md or inferred), exact relative paths if available.
2. **Table of Contents** — Clickable links to each file section.
3. **File-by-File Summaries** — For each file, use heading `### <file path>`. Show:
   - Source MD file name
   - Role (short sentence)
   - Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.)
   - Features (Admin vs User)
   - Top Extension Opportunities
   - Suggested Next Files (from that MD)
4. **Common Features and Patterns** — Summarize shared practices across files.
5. **Extension Opportunities** — Consolidated list of best extension points.
6. **Next Files to Analyze** — Aggregate all suggestions, dedupe, and exclude any in completed_files.txt. Show:
   - Exact relative path
   - Priority (High/Med/Low)
   - One-line reason
   - Which MD(s) recommended it
7. **Excluded Recommendations** — List any that were dropped due to completed_files.txt.
8. **Sources** — List uploaded .md file names + completed_files.txt.

Format strictly in Markdown with these sections:
