## Common Features and Patterns
- Heavy use of **WordPress hooks** (`add_action`, `add_filter`) for modularity.
- Core business logic separated into `/core` utilities and `/includes/page-*` for UI screens.
- User-facing functionality mainly exposed via **shortcodes** and **front-end assets**.
- Admin functionality primarily provided through **custom menu pages** and WP_List_Table.

## Extension Opportunities
- Introduce **custom REST API endpoints** for bookings (to support external integrations).
- Add **block editor components** for booking forms (instead of just shortcodes).
- Expand **filter/action hooks** in key files to improve customizability.
- Implement **caching or optimization layers** around date availability functions.
