You are an expert WordPress plugin developer with deep knowledge of PHP (8.2.27), MySQL (8.0.35), and WordPress (6.8.2).

Your task:
1. Analyze the implementation and purpose of the following file in this WordPress plugin repository: [FILE_PATH].
2. Provide a high-level overview of what this file does and how it fits into the plugin’s architecture.
3. Drill down into a more detailed explanation:
   - Key functions, classes, or hooks used.
   - How it interacts with WordPress core APIs or database.
   - Any features implemented or enabled by this file for:
     - The **WordPress Admin Menu** (e.g. new settings pages, options, meta boxes).
     - The **User-facing side** (e.g. shortcodes, widgets, blocks, REST endpoints, front-end hooks).
   - Extension points (filters, actions, or patterns I can reuse).
   - Any potential risks or limitations in the current implementation.
4. Make recommendations on how I could extend or modify this file safely to add new functionality.
5. Suggest 2–3 other files in this plugin that I should analyze next, with reasoning for why they matter.

Output format:
- Write the response as a structured **Markdown (.md)** file with:
  - A clear title and intro
  - Sections for:
    - High-Level Overview
    - Detailed Explanation
    - Features Enabled (Admin vs User)
    - Extension Opportunities
    - Next File Recommendations
  - Use bulleted/numbered lists for clarity
  - Include code snippets if useful
